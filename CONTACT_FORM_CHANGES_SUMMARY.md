## Technical Changes

### Before (Old System)

```javascript
// Old method - using mailto: links
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const mailto = `mailto:jlmiller12s@gmail.com?subject=...&body=...`;
  window.location.href = mailto;
});
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Opens email client (poor UX)
- ❌ Doesn't work if user has no email client
- ❌ Can't track deliveries
- ❌ No validation or error handling
- ❌ Unreliable on mobile devices

### After (New System)

```javascript
// New method - API endpoint with Resend
form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/contact-form', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name, email, message, formType })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    // Show success message
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Professional email delivery
- ✅ Works on all devices
- ✅ Track deliveries in Resend dashboard
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Validated on server-side
- ✅ Reply-to automatically set to sender
- ✅ No spam folder issues (with proper DNS)

- Sends from `noreply@altaredalchemie.com` instead of `@resend.dev`
- Requires DNS records (SPF, DKIM)
- See `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for instructions
- **Can skip for testing** - will send from @resend.dev temporarily

### 3. Zoho Email
- No changes needed
- Just receive emails normally
- Add `noreply@altaredalchemie.com` to safe senders (optional)

## What to Do Next

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Connect contact forms to Zoho via Resend API"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify RESEND_API_KEY** in Vercel environment variables

3. **Test all forms** on live site

### Soon (Recommended)

4. **Set up custom domain** in Resend (see `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
   - Prevents "via resend.dev" in emails
   - Better deliverability
   - More professional

5. **Monitor Resend dashboard** for first week
   - Check delivery rates
   - Watch for bounces or spam reports

### Optional (Nice to Have)

6. **Set up email autoresponder** (future enhancement)
   - Auto-reply to form submissions
   - "Thanks, we'll respond within 24hrs"

7. **Add Resend webhooks** (future enhancement)
   - Track opens and clicks
   - Log failed deliveries
