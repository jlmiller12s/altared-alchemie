## ⏳ PENDING

### Deployment to Live Site
The code is committed locally but push to GitHub is having issues due to large video files in the repository.

## 🎯 OPTIONS TO GO LIVE

### Option 1: Manual File Upload (Quickest)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Upload just these files:
   - `downloads.html`
   - `index.html` (updated with Downloads link)
   - `env.js` (with Stripe public key)
4. Vercel will auto-deploy

### Option 2: Fix Git and Push
1. Remove large video files from git history:
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path legacy-avatar/Avatar-vids --invert-paths
   ```
2. Then push normally:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Direct Vercel Deploy
1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 📝 IMPORTANT FILES FOR PRODUCTION

When deploying, make sure these are updated on live site:

### Frontend Files:
- ✅ `downloads.html` - The new downloads page
- ✅ `index.html` - Updated navigation
- ✅ `env.js` - Stripe publishable key (test or live)

### Backend Files (server directory):
- ✅ `server/src/index.js` - Payment endpoints
- ✅ `server/package.json` - Stripe dependency added
- ⚠️ `server/.env` - **MUST UPDATE** on production server with live Stripe keys

## ⚠️ BEFORE GOING LIVE

### Switch to Live Stripe Keys
Currently using TEST keys. To accept real payments:

1. **Update `env.js` line 10:**
   ```javascript
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: 'pk_live_YOUR_LIVE_KEY'
   ```

2. **Update production `server/.env` line 2:**
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_KEY
   ```

3. **Set up webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard:
   - URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - Add webhook secret to `server/.env`

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test Locally (Currently Working):
```
http://localhost:5177/downloads.html
```

### Test Card Details:
- Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
