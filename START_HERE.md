## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't create a good PDF!"
- Use the templates in PRODUCT_TEMPLATES.md
- Google Docs is enough!
- V1 doesn't have to be perfect
- Ship it now, improve it later

### "No one is buying!"
- Have you messaged 20+ people DIRECTLY?
- Did you post on 2+ platforms?
- Try: "First 3 people comment 'ME' get it FREE for a review!"

### "I don't know what to charge!"
- $3-$5 is PERFECT for your first sale
- Low price = easier first sale
- You can raise prices after you have testimonials

### "I'm scared/nervous!"
- EVERYONE feels this way
- Your first sale is the hardest
- Just send to ONE friend first
- Build from there!

---

## 💡 WHAT TO DO AFTER FIRST SALE

### Get Testimonial:
```
Hey [Name]! Did you get a chance to check out the guide?

I'm collecting testimonials - would you mind sharing what 
you thought? Even just 1-2 sentences would be amazing!

P.S. - If you send me a video testimonial (30 seconds), 
I'll refund you $2! 🎥
```

### Create Social Proof Post:
```
🎉 FIRST SALE! 🎉

Thank you to [First Name] for being my FIRST customer!

This is just the beginning...

Who's ready to be customer #2?
