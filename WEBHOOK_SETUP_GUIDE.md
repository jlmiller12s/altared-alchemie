After a customer completes payment, they automatically receive an email with:

## ðŸš€ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Sign Up for Resend (Free)

### Step 6: Upload Your App Files

You need to host the actual installer files somewhere. Options:

   - `devdoc-voice-generator-mac-arm.dmg`
4. Make them public or generate signed URLs

**Option B: AWS S3**
- Similar process, create bucket and upload files

**Option C: GitHub Releases**
- Create a release in your Devdoc repo
- Upload installers as release assets
- Use the download URLs

### Step 7: Update Download URLs

Edit `api/stripe-webhook.js` and update the download links (around line 35):

```javascript
const downloadLinks = {
  'windows': 'https://your-actual-url.com/devdoc-voice-generator-windows.exe',
  'mac-intel': 'https://your-actual-url.com/devdoc-voice-generator-mac-intel.dmg',
  'mac-arm': 'https://your-actual-url.com/devdoc-voice-generator-mac-arm.dmg'
};
```

### Step 8: Redeploy
