## üí≥ Test Payment Flow

1. **Fill out the form:**
   - Email: Use your real email (you'll get redirected to Stripe)
   - Name: Your name
   - Platform: Select Windows, macOS Intel, or macOS Apple Silicon
   - Check the terms checkbox

2. **Click "Purchase Now - $49"**

3. **You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout** (secure payment page)

4. **Use a REAL credit card** (this is LIVE mode!)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** You're using LIVE keys, so real cards will be charged
   - üí∞ Test with a small amount if you want, or use Test Mode (see below)

5. **Complete the payment**

6. **Get redirected back** with success message

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Switch to Test Mode (Recommended for Testing)

Since you're using **LIVE keys**, real payments will be charged. To test safely:

### Step 1: Get Test Keys from Stripe

1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard
2. **Toggle "Test mode"** switch (top right corner)
3. Go to Developers ‚Üí API Keys
4. Copy your TEST keys (they start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)

### Step 2: Replace with Test Keys

**In `env.js`:**
```javascript
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: 'pk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY_HERE'
```

**In `server/.env`:**
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 4: Test with Test Card
Use these test cards (TEST MODE ONLY):

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Success |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Decline |
| 4000 0027 6000 3184 | 3D Secure |

- Any future expiration date
- Any 3-digit CVC
- Any postal code

## üîî Next: Set Up Webhooks

After successful test payment, set up webhooks to handle post-payment actions:

### For Local Testing:
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# Then run:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5179/api/stripe/webhook

# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_...) and add to server/.env:
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

### For Production:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `server/.env`

## üìß Implement Email Delivery

When payment succeeds, you'll want to send:
1. Download link for the app
2. License key
3. Getting started guide

Update `server/src/index.js` in the webhook handler (around line 183) to send emails.
