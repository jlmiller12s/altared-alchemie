## 💰 MARKETING TIPS - Get Your First Customer

### 1. Start With Your Network (Easiest!)
Send a personal message to 10-20 friends/family:

```

I created a Faith & Fitness Challenge Guide (7-day devotional + workouts) 
for just $5. Would love your support! 🙏

Check it out: [YOUR LINK]

P.S. - If you grab it, let me know what you think! ❤️
```

### 2. Post on Social Media
**Instagram/Facebook Post Idea:**
```
🚨 NEW LAUNCH! 🚨

After months of work, I'm finally launching my digital products!

✨ Faith & Fitness Challenge Guide - $5
💼 Business Vision Planner - $4
🙏 Daily Gratitude Journal - $3

Perfect for anyone wanting to:
- Grow their faith
- Get in shape
- Plan their business
- Develop a gratitude practice

Who's ready to transform their life with me? 🚀
```

### 3. Create Urgency
Add to your posts:
- "First 10 customers get a bonus template FREE!"
- "Launch special: 50% off first 24 hours!" (adjust prices temporarily)
- "Only 5 copies left at this price!"

### 4. Show Social Proof
Once you get your first sale:
- Screenshot the "payment successful" notification (blur personal info)
- Post: "OMG! Just made my first sale! 🎉 Thank you [First Name]!"
- This creates FOMO and trust

## 📦 IMPORTANT: Set Up Product Delivery

For now, create simple PDFs for your products:

### Quick PDF Creation:

   - Go to Canva.com (free)
   - Search for "Workbook Template" or "Journal Template"
   - Customize with your content
   - Download as PDF
   - Save to your computer

2. **After Someone Purchases**:
   - You'll get an email from Stripe
   - Send the PDF manually via email with subject: "Your [Product Name] - Thank You!"
   - Use this template:

```
Subject: Your Faith & Fitness Challenge Guide - Thank You! 🎉
